# OpenCV-FacialEmotion-Detection
This project implements real-time facial detection using OpenCV and integrates emotion recognition with DeepFace. It leverages Haar cascade classifiers for face detection and deep learning models for emotion analysis, providing an interactive and efficient way to analyze human expressions in live video feeds.
